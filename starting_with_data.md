FROM all_sessions
GROUP BY v2productname
ORDER BY "Number of Unique Visits" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Answer:

## Question 2:  What were the main sources that brought traffic to the website?

### SQL Queries:

```
SELECT 
	channelgrouping AS "Channel Groupings",
	COUNT(DISTINCT(fullvisitorid)) AS "Number of Unique Visits",
	ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT(fullvisitorid)) / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT(fullvisitorid))) OVER () * 100, 2) AS "Rate of Unique Visits by Channel Grouping"
FROM all_sessions
GROUP BY channelgrouping
ORDER BY "Number of Unique Visits" DESC;
```

### Answer:

More than half of the traffic (58%) came through Organic Search, which refers to traffic from search engine results such as Google or Bing. Approximately one-fifth of the traffic originated from an unknown referrer or source. Paid Search accounted for only 3% of the total traffic.

|Channel Groupings	|Number of Unique Visits	|Rate of Unique Visits by Channel Grouping|
|--------|---------|-------|
|Organic Search	|8207	|57.51|
|Direct	|2805	|19.66|
|Referral	|2419	|16.95|
|Paid Search	|470	|3.29|
|Affiliates	|245	|1.72|
|Display	|119	|0.83|
|(Other)	|5	|0.04|


## Question 3: Is there any difference in the primary traffic source on the platform between countries?


### SQL Queries:

```
WITH total_number_of_unique_visits AS (
    SELECT 
        country, 
        channelgrouping, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT(fullvisitorid)) AS "Number of Unique Visits",
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT(fullvisitorid)) DESC) AS rn
    FROM all_sessions
	WHERE country NOT IN ('(not set)')
    GROUP BY country, channelgrouping
)
SELECT 
    country AS "Country",
    channelgrouping AS "Channel Groupings",
    "Number of Unique Visits"
FROM total_number_of_unique_visits
WHERE rn = 1 AND "Number of Unique Visits" > 10
ORDER BY "Number of Unique Visits" DESC;
```

### Answer:

Out of the 56 countries with more than ten visits, Organic Search was the primary source of traffic in all cases except for two instancesâ€”Romania and Finland. In these countries, Direct traffic emerged as the primary source, driving the majority of visits.

Country	|Channel Groupings	|Number of Unique Visits
---|----|----
United States	|Organic Search	|4008
United Kingdom	|Organic Search	|509
